Predicting how a customer will feel about a product before they even ordered it

Problem statement: For a given customer's historical data, we are tasked to predict the review score for the next order or purchase. We will be using the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. This dataset has information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing charges from various dimensions: from order status, price, payment, freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally, reviews written by customers. The objective here is to predict the customer satisfaction score for a given order based on features like order status, price, payment, etc. In order to achieve this in a real-world scenario, we will be using ZenML to build a production-ready pipeline to predict the customer satisfaction score for the next order or purchase.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how ZenML empowers your business to build and deploy machine learning pipelines in a multitude of ways:

By offering you a framework and template to base your own work on.
By integrating with tools like MLflow for deployment, tracking and more
By allowing you to build and deploy your machine learning pipelines easily
